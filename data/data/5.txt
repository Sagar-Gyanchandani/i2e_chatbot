Customer Story: Qantas Airways Limited                

A modern work environment is one that empowers employees at all levels to make good decisions by arming them with the information they need. Empowerment fosters creativity, which in turn leads to valuable innovations that improve customer experience.
Qantas Airways uses the cloud to keep all of their employees updated with real-time information, no matter where they are. They trust Microsoft 365 to keep that data secure on whatever device the employee choses to use.
Don’t let security concerns hold your employees back. We at i2e Consulting are excited to help your business unlock its full potential.

Broadclyst School–Communicating with Skype                

i2e Consulting shows how Microsoft Office 365 with Skype for Business facilitates real-time communication and collaboration among student teams across geographies.  
Skype’s video-conferencing and group-calling features support the Broadclyst School’s curriculum and enhance pupil engagement, but that’s not all. Using Skype, parents can attend and participate virtually in school meetings when they can’t be there in person–connecting them with their children’s learning. Let us help you reap the benefits of stronger partnerships too.
