How SharePoint can help you grow your business - i2e Consulting

SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. It is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is said to have multiple applications in various fields and usage varies substantially between organizations.
Apart from this, SharePoint allows for storage, retrieval, searching, archiving, tracking, management, and reporting on electronic documents and records. Many of the functions in this product are designed around various legal, information management, and process requirements in organizations. SharePoint also provides search and ‘graph’ functionality. It is an industry leading platform for intranets, secure document management, collaboration, and much more.
Over 78% of Fortune 500 companies use this tool to develop their online and offline capabilities. Companies cite two principal reasons for adoption: one, the need for a flexible platform that provides a basis for ad hoc collaboration of project teams without the intervention of IT, and two, the need to consolidate the plethora of legacy systems acquired over decades, which are expensive to maintain.
In its most basic essence, SharePoint is a kind of an online collaborative solution Enterprise content management (ECM) is a set of defined processes, strategies and tools that allow a business to effectively obtain, organize, store and deliver critical information to its employees, business stakeholders and customers.
One of the modifications, SharePoint Online, is a cloud-based service hosted by Microsoft for businesses of all sizes. Instead of installing and deploying SharePoint Server on-premises, any business can subscribe to an Office 365 plan or to the standalone SharePoint Online service. Employees can create sites to share documents and information with colleagues, partners, and customers.
The world today is known for all things online, from meetings to meetups to tracking assets and goods. Most large institutions today have requirement of an institution Intranet, a network accessible to those associated with a company, which provides a place for storage and ready access, and at the same time, ensuring that no unauthorized access from outside the network can do things with the network.
SharePoint is a platform which provides these intranet facilities. What is more, instead of using systems like mass mail, which can be a tough task, given the size and selectivity that MNCs have to function with today, SharePoint also has a platform for immediate sharing of documents and files with those with a need to access, with extreme efficiency and security. Finally, gone are the days when records were things to be stored in closets. Now the system needs to be availed at the click of a button, and what better and easier way to access than SharePoint.
All in all, SharePoint is an in vogue, sure shot digital manager that businesses of the modern world absolutely need for making their businesses expand. It is like telling the computer to do things one evening and having it with your tea the next morning.
