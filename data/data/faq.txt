Cloudflare's Free plan provides the most basic website performance and security features. If you need more, you can always upgrade to a higher tier plan.What determines the total amount billed?Our pricing is on a 'per-domain' basis. That means that every domain is charged separately - whereas the number of subdomains does not make a difference. For example, if you upgrade example1.com and example2.com to the Pro plan, they will be charged separately, and you will pay $40/month. You can have as many subdomains like test1.example1.com or test2.example1.com as you want, and this will not incur any extra charges.When is my billing date?The date you first select a paid plan will be the recurring billing date. For example: If you sign up for the first time on January 10, all future charges will be billed on the 10th of every month.What happens when I upgrade?If you currently have a paid plan (e.g. Pro) for one of your domains and upgrade to a higher priced plan (e.g. Business), the following happens:You will be debited the hourly pro-rata cost of the Business plan until the end of the billing cycleYou will be credited the hourly pro-rata cost of the Pro plan until the end of the billing cycleAt the beginning of the next billing cycle, you will be charged for the full cost of the Business planYou will receive an invoice upon successful payment of the upgradeWhat happens when I downgrade?If you select a domain and downgrade from a higher-priced plan (e.g. Business) to a lower-priced plan (e.g. Pro), the following happens:Your domain will immediately be downgraded and no longer benefit from the higher-level Cloudflare plan you have pre-paid forYour billing will be adjusted at the start of the next billing cycle to reflect the Pro plan's chargesYou will not receive a refund for the funds you have pre-paid for the higher priced planHow are prorations calculated?If you are moving from a lower-priced plan to a higher-priced plan, you are charged as follows:Pro-rata remaining days = # of days remaining in the current billing cycle / # of total days in the billing cycleCredit for unused lower priced plan = price of lower plan * pro-rata remaining daysDebit for remaining higher-priced plan = price of higher plan * pro-rata remaining daysAmount Due for Zone = Debit for higher-priced plan - Credit of lower-priced planWhat happens if I add a plan in the middle of my subscription period?Your additional zone will be charged for the pro-rata time used for the selected plan. For example:Your first zone is subscribed to a paid plan on the 10th of the month and you add a second zone on the 20th day of a 30 day monthYou will be charged an additional (20/30) * price of the second planOn the next billing cycle (10th of the next month) you will be charged the full price for both plansGetting StartedFree plansFor enterprisesCompare plansGet a recommendationRequest a demoContact salesResourcesLearning centerAnalyst reportsCloudflare RadarCloudflare TVCase studiesWebinarsWhite PapersDeveloper docsArchitecture CentertheNETBlogSolutionsConnectivity cloudSSE and SASE servicesApplication servicesNetwork servicesDeveloper servicesCommunityCommunity hubProject GalileoAthenian ProjectCloudflare for CampaignsCritical Infrastructure Defense ProjectConnect 2024SupportHelp centerCloudflare statusComplianceGDPRTrust & safetyCompanyAbout CloudflareOur teamInvestor relationsPressCareersDiversity, equity, & inclusionImpact/ESGNetwork mapLogos & press kitBecome a partner© 2024 Cloudflare, Inc.Privacy PolicyTerms of UseReport Security IssuesCookie PreferencesTrademark
