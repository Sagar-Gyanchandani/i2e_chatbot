Clairvoyance: End-to-end analytics



Make portfolio decisions with confidence with Clairvoyance by your side 

  

Biopharmaceutical R&D operates through a high-risk, 	high-value business model, relying heavily on strategic portfolio management to maximize the potential of inline brands and driving future pipeline growth through R&D investments and targeted business development programs. Long pipeline development lifecycles in the past did not mandate fast and integrated decision tools.  With increasing late-stage failures, focus on life cycle throughput, emergence of more personalized disease therapy modalities affecting the shape, speed, cost, and competition in clinical development, there is an emerging urgency to develop robust pipeline analytics to better understand and manage risk, secure value, and sustain growth.



Our proprietary project portfolio and forecasting platform, Clairvoyance, generates highly accurate and reliable forecasts that inform strategic decisions throughout your product's lifecycle. Whether choosing the best asset development plan, mapping market entry strategies, navigating access and reimbursement landscapes, or optimizing supply chain operations, Clairvoyance equips you with foresight to drive commercial success.

How can Clairvoyance help you?

Centralize decision making platform for your portfolio at a click.



One dashboard, many decisions: Clairvoyance offers a consolidated view of the project portfolio, providing senior executives with a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making. Clairvoyance automates project data integration, data aggregation and summarization of crucial portfolio metrics and insights, all in one consolidated dashboard. 

Efficiently managed project data can provide crucial financial and operational metrics such as project delivery milestone dates, development cost forecast, and revenue forecasts, with appropriate risk adjustments based on Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success (PTRS) and potential market events. 



Risk visibility for informed decisions: Get visibility into aggregate risks (clinical, regulatory, commercial) at each risk gate in your development cycle to understand costs and timing decisions. Clairvoyance aggregates internal and external information (competitive intelligence) at every stage to help you take the right decisions about time-to-market, launch and commercialization that maximize the economic value of your clinical assets.



Evidence based decisions: Clairvoyance helps portfolio leaders remove bias from decision making, whether it is patient forecast or revenue forecasts. We help therapy area leaders avoid pitfalls such as focus on short term trade-offs that derail long-term organizational growth, concessions arising due to lack of data visibility into the asset pipeline, answering what-if scenarios confidently.




Clairvoyance for Big Pharma



The traditionally siloed scientific, development and commercial functions in biopharma companies have made it difficult to assemble the pipeline knowledge required to prepare real-time portfolio insight, analysis, and investment options. To enable visibility and transparency, portfolio leaders have looked to either point solutions or custom development.



Traditional approaches of deploying fragmented point solutions or custom one-off projects simply cannot scale to meet the evolving needs of your organization. Point solutions provide temporary fixes but lack the adaptability for long-term robustness. While custom builds allow for tailored solutions, their static nature cannot persist or flex with your changing priorities and market dynamics. You're forced to compromise - sacrificing control for rapid customizability or vice versa.



Our fit-for-purpose decision analytics platform has been designed by industry leading practitioners who are highly sought after advisors in strategic portfolio management.  They have architected and developed a portfolio decision platform, configurable to interface with standard enterprise data systems and custom fit to adapt to existing systems.
