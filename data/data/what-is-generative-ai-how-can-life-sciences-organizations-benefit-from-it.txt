What is Generative AI & How Can Life Sciences Organizations Benefit from it                                 

April 1, 2024                                

Life sciences industry is experiencing its own gen AI revolution resulting in efficient clinical trials, accelerated dug discovery, quicker document summarizations, chatbots taking over repetitive manual tasks, and we are just getting started. 
When used effectively, gen AI can assist in almost all the departments and stakeholders right from R&D to commercialization of a drug. 
In this blog we bring you a few basics about Generative AI, its applications throughout the drug development life cycle, and some potential use cases. 
How Does Generative AI Work? 
Generative AI operates through intricate neural network mechanisms, mimicking the complexities of the human brain. At its core, these networks process vast datasets, learning patterns and structures to produce original content autonomously. Discoveries in in-depth learning have driven generative models to elevated heights, allowing them to tackle various data categories such as text, images, and music.  
Now, let’s look at the gen AI models closely.  
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are the innovators in this area. They are revolutionizing various processes with their ability to generate more authentic new data from a given training dataset. 
These foundational models serve as the backbone for subsequent advancements, reshaping language and image processing. This is useful in creating artificial data sets (to train machine languages) where obtaining real-world data is tedious or violates patient privacy. 
For example, using a combination of GAN and VAE networks, the Centre for Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling, Coventry University, proposed a framework to generate artificial brain tumor MR images. These helped in training machine learning models used in classification of brain tumors which resulted in increased efficiency of these models from 72.63% to 96.25% (1). 
Generative AI in the Life Sciences Industry 
Generative AI is emerging as a new powerful tool in the world of life sciences. By using its power to analyze massive medical datasets, Generative AI is transforming business processes across the drug development life cycle. Leading to decreasing the time to market and providing superior and patient centric healthcare.  
With less than 10% of drug discovery efforts yielding breakthroughs, Generative AI appears as a game changer. It enhances compound screening, suggests feasible therapies, and simulates molecular dynamics for deeper drug behavior understanding. Plus, it also helps in making the clinical trial process more efficient and accurate, resulting in decreased costs and improved trial results.  
Applications of Gen AI Throughout the Drug Development Lifecycle 
Gen AI’s ability to use diverse data sources and create customized content can help in many ways. For example, it can accelerate drug development processes, compress asset lifecycles, speed up therapy development, FDA approvals, and finally commercialization. 
Let us discover in detail the impactful role of generative AI in driving innovation in the drug development life cycle. 

Research & development (R&D) 

Gen AI is streamlining R&D in the life sciences industry by systematizing content extraction from different sources, including patents and scientific papers. Unlike traditional NLP, AI tools provide deeper insights into medical context and intent, simplifying open-ended questions and seamless integration of evidence. This streamlines research, requiring minimal additional training for tailored results. 

Clinical trials 

Gen AI optimizes patient selection through biomarker-driven precision medicine. By leveraging genetic, phenotypic, and real-world data, AI models identify patient subgroups for tailored treatments, enhancing trial diversity and efficiency. Moreover, AI analyzes medical images to uncover hidden biomarkers, enabling shorter trials and unforeseen treatment discoveries with higher success rates. 

Commercialization 

AI models can expedite life sciences marketing as they enable customized content creation and real-time campaign adjustments. They even leverage brands to refine strategies promptly, for smarter decisions. This promises efficiency gains and enhanced campaign effectiveness. Gen AI also assists in personalizing campaigns for more precision in targeting. 
Let us look at some of the potential real-world use cases of Gen AI in Life sciences. 
Use Case 1: Leveraging smart data management  
With tons of data pouring in constantly, data management is a labor-intensive and expensive affair for the life sciences companies; However, with a combination of traditional and Gen AI techniques, it can be automated smartly. Routine manual tasks like reviewing and configuring the data are streamlined, improving overall efficiency. A few clicks and the vast data are segregated as per the organizational protocols. Case report forms can be auto generated based on the protocols, and patient profiles. The data quality can also be enhanced by real-time cleaning and bridging the critical gaps through intelligent query generation. This smart approach accelerates clinical trials, utilizes resources optimally, and speeds up the outcomes.  
Use Case 2: Optimizing indication selection 
Indication selection for asset strategy in biopharma involves making critical decisions based on conditions to target a specific molecule. Despite the plethora of available information from various sources like opinion leaders, literature reviews, and trial data, the traditional approach often overlooks crucial evidence.  
On the other hand, Gen AI addresses this challenge by analyzing structured and unstructured datasets comprehensively. It leverages Real-World Data (RWD) and molecular knowledge graphs to expose semantic similarities between events and estimate biological proximity. By tapping into overlooked RWD and identifying new connections, Gen AI facilitates the discovery of novel indications, accelerating validation processes and minimizing opportunity costs. This advanced approach enhances decision-making by integrating diverse data sources and uncovering previously missed correlations, thereby improving the overall success of drug development endeavors. 
Use Case 3: Accelerating clinical trial outcomes 
Gen AI also serves as an effective assistant in clinical trial management by swiftly processing huge data to offer actionable understandings and boost trial outcomes. Leading pharmaceutical firms are embracing the Gen AI advancements to make operational decisions and accelerate trials. It is also offering custom insights, smart alerts for discussions, and automated communication. This can streamline cross-functional collaboration. These tools also update enrollment by automating analyses, addressing enrollment hurdles, and fostering teamwork. Gen AI’s multifaceted support transforms clinical trials, promising faster, more efficient processes, and improved outcomes. 
Use Case 4: Streamlining patient engagement and recruitment through AI chatbots 
AI Chatbots is reforming patient engagement in clinical trials by providing quick responses to patient queries, helping them through trial information, and conducting pre-screening questionnaires. The chatbots also update the recruitment procedure, thereby cutting down time and resources while offering effective and precise patient selection.  
In the pharmaceutical industry, these chatbots improve customer interactions through customized information about treatments, medications, and even their side effects. This is not all, timely support is also offered so patients can make sound decisions in time. AI chatbots are indeed offering advanced patient engagement solutions along with all-around support through clinical trials for life sciences organizations. 
Generative AI is proving to be a driving force in life sciences organizations. It is not only about creating but going beyond and changing the game. From researching comprehensive data to transforming pharma methodologies, the influence of AI is profound. Any new guesses for what may happen in the world of Generative AI further? Well, hang tight as many more innovations are waiting to be uncovered! 
Future Directions of Generative AI  
Looking ahead, the future of generative AI in life sciences is full of promise and excitement. It’s all about staying informed, collaborating, and promoting ethical practices. Going forward, AI can be helpful in accelerating drug discovery while ensuring fair and reasonable patient care. 
From continuous learning to sharing valuable insights, every step counts. Generative AI is shaping a future where innovation and patient well-being go parallel. With visionary leadership and a commitment to excellence, the possibilities are endless.
