Project Emma: This invention helped me write again                

At i2e Consulting, we know that AI and machine learning are powerful tools that can help organizations control their destiny. Just look at how Microsoft technology is helping Dr. Haiyan Zhang to stabilize tremors in Parkinson’s patients.  
With Microsoft technology, Haiyan created a device that analyzes a patient’s biometrics and produces vibrations to stabilize the patient’s hand. With Azure, businesses have access to AI that can provide their organization with actionable insights, giving users better control of their company.  
We can help your business integrate this data-maximizing technology and make your ideas come to life. Contact us to find out how.

Customer Story: Fresno Unified School District
