A headless version of the Chromium browser runs all browser code on Cloudflare's global network, instead of on your endpoints.
Unlike pixel pushing or DOM rendering, Cloudflare streams draw commands, which use less bandwidth and create a seamless user experience.
Security patches for zero-day vulnerabilities are automatically deployed to remote browsers on Cloudflare's network.
