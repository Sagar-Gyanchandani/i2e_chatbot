We don’t have to think about regions, we just deploy code and it runs seamlessly around the world.”Great power.Less responsibility.Automatic scalingNo more configuring auto-scaling, load balancers, or paying for capacity you don’t use. Traffic is automatically routed and load balanced across thousands of servers. Sleep well as your code scales effortlessly.High performance global networkEvery deploy is made to a network of data centers running V8 isolates. Your code is powered by Cloudflare’s network which is milliseconds away from virtually every Internet user.Write in JS, Rust, C, and C++Choose from a template in your language to kickstart building an app, creating a function, or writing an API. We have templates, tutorials, and a CLI to get you up and running in no time.Support for 0ms cold startsMost serverless platforms experience a cold start every time you deploy or your service increases in popularity. Workers can run your code instantly, without cold starts.Exceptionally affordableThe first 100,000 requests each day are free and paid plans start at just $5/10 million requests, making Workers as much as ten-times less expensive than other serverless platforms.For a 50ms Worker compute workload including API Gateway & other required servicesNo servers to maintainSpend more time building, less time configuring. No VMs, no servers, and no containers to spin up or manage. Deploy using our CLI, web interface, or API.Edge storage, built inStore your static assets at the edge with Workers KV, our global, low-latency key-value data store. Access your assets alongside your code and transform them via powerful APIs (e.g. HTMLrewriter) to modify your page before it reaches the user.Static assets with dynamic powerSay goodbye to build steps which pre-generate thousands of assets in advance. Harness the unrivaled raw power of the edge to generate images, SVGs, PDFs, whatever you need, on the fly, and deliver them to users as quickly as a static asset.Build your first Worker now.Start buildingBuilding with WorkersFree100,000 requests per day(Across all of your Worker scripts, UTC+0)Deploy up to 100 Worker scriptsRuns on all 275+ network locationsFree workers.dev subdomainUp to 10ms CPU time per requestLowest latency after the first requestLimited Workers KV edge storageGet startedGet startedPaid$0.15/million requests per month(Minimum charge of $5/mo)Everything in Free, plus:Up to 30s of CPU time per requestAlways lowest latencyAdditional Workers KV edge storage  Get startedProductCloudflare PagesKey-value storageCachePricingDocsTutorialsTemplatesTooling referenceAPI referenceAboutHow it worksBuilt withYouTubeBlogHelpStatusDiscordSupportTwitter© 2021 Cloudflare, Inc. · Privacy · Terms · Cookie Settings
