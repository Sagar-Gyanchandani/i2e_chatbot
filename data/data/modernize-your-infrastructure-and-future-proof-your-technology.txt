With end of support for Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 fast approaching, now is the time to start thinking about modernizing your infrastructure.

After these dates, Microsoft will no longer release security updates, which may expose you to security attacks or compliance risks with industry regulations such as GDPR. Avoid business disruptions and use this as an opportunity to modernize your IT infrastructure by moving it to the Microsoft Azure cloud.






48% of small businesses say new technology will influence growth over the next three years1



Along with optimizing costs, reducing security threats, and increasing consistency across your infrastructure, migrating to the Microsoft cloud increases scalability and flexibility if your business is growing or has fluctuating capacity needs. In addition, your security updates are extended meaning you get to protect your business data – and your brand reputation.
