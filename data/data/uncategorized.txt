Technological Positives of 2020                

Looking back as the curtains fall for 2020, we can only say this has been one challenging year. So much that the TIME’s December 14th cover crosses out the bane of the year that is 2020 itself with a red “X”. However, there is some good in all this, nature is thriving, humanity is still alive, OTT platforms have soared, and remote work is the new […]

Why the pharmaceutical industry is investing in Cloud Computing now more than ever?

Project Emma: This invention helped me write again
