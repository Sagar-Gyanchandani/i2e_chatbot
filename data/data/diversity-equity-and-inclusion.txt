The reason is simple. Diverse teams are more effective, innovative, and better positioned to drive growth, and without an equitable and inclusive working environment, our diverse teams won’t succeed.
Cloudflare's mission is to help build a better Internet, and in order to do this we need a range of perspectives and approaches. Since founding Cloudflare we set out to cultivate and maintain an inclusive workplace which empowers all employees to show up, as their full selves, and do their best work."

Michelle Zatlyn Co-founder, President & COO, CloudflareCloudflare CapabilitiesCulture is defined by the behaviors you reward. We created the Cloudflare Capabilities so we could be open and clear about the behaviors that get rewarded at Cloudflare. They are the bedrock of our culture. We use them when making hiring decisions, evaluating performance or considering promotions. They are an important part of our DEI work as they provide the foundation to help build a more welcoming and inclusive culture where everyone can build the career of their dreams.Diversity at CloudflareOver the years, we've been working hard to better understand the makeup of our teams and increase our diversity. We are proud to have reached a point where we are ready to publish Cloudflare’s employee representation data and share how we are working to diversify our teams.

Cloudflare’s Recruiting team works closely with hiring managers to make job descriptions clear, detailed, welcoming, and inclusive. Hiring Managers also ensure that all candidates have the same experience and sets of questions asked/focus areas covered in their interviews so the process is fair and equitable for all.To make sure candidates meet with a diverse group of employees, we always use interview panels within our hiring process. We recently developed an interview that focuses on the Cloudflare Capabilities, which pairs the candidate with a member from another team within Cloudflare and adds an even greater diverse perspective when it comes to hiring decisions.Recruiting EducationOur interviewer training program provides a solid foundation in understanding the various topics which can impact inclusive hiring. This program is required for all new employees and will set them up for success when they begin interviewing for Cloudflare in the future.We also have a robust training and coaching program for hiring managers that ensures they understand the full scope of our hiring process and what they can do to champion diversity and facilitate an inclusive hiring process.Equity at CloudflareOur success also relies on a fair and equitable workplace.
