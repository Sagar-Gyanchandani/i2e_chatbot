Ensuring that at-risk public interest groups stay online


Founded in 2014, Project Galileo is our response to devastating cyber attacks launched against important yet vulnerable targets, like artistic groups, humanitarian organizations, and the voices of political dissent.

Through Project Galileo, Cloudflare provides free, robust security to enterprises that are the targets of DDoS and other cyber attacks.

The Internet is a powerful tool for spreading and expanding ideas. When journalists, social activists, and minority groups are flooded with malicious traffic in an attempt to knock them offline, the Internet stops fulfilling its promise.



Such organizations often face attacks from powerful and entrenched opponents, yet operate on limited budgets.

 We offer services through Project Galileo to any proposed recipient if brought to us by or approved by any one of our trusted partners. Such inclusion does not require and should not be understood as endorsement by all our diverse partner organizations.

Examples of participants include, but are not limited to, minority rights organizations, human rights organizations, independent media outlets, arts groups, and democracy protection programs.
