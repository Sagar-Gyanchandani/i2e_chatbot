The pay-as-you-go model of cloud services ensures that pharmaceutical companies pay only for the resources they use. SharePoint offers various licensing and subscription models, providing flexibility in choosing plans based on specific needs. These factors make SharePoint a value-first choice for meeting the collaboration needs of the pharmaceutical organizations.

Sales teams that operate from various locations globally can access information on the go. Furthermore, SharePoint has strong security features to safeguard private information, including threat detection and two-factor authentication. 

SharePoint is a useful tool for the life sciences sales and marketing teams because of these characteristics, which also help them manage intellectual property, uphold compliance, and drive better collaboration.
