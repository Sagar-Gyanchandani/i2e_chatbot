Business Process Automation SharePoint | Microsoft Flows, Power Apps                                

September 4, 2019                                

Digital workplaces are transforming the way companies run businesses. One of the many ways to stay relevant in these rapidly changing times is business process automation. Use of technology to execute manual routine tasks that consume a major chunk of working hours is business processes automation. It increases efficiency and streamlines processes. Automation is the stepping step to achieving real digital transformation.  
Automation with Microsoft Flow and PowerApps 
Tools and software that can carry out time consuming tasks on their own are not alien yet it is often seen organization fail to fully utilize them. Through this blog, we would like to discuss how with the use of Microsoft Flow and PowerApps, organizations can leverage automation. Flow and PowerApps have been introduced around the same time. While the former is used to automate workflows across multiple applications and services, the latter is more about the user interface for building mobile apps. Microsoft PowerApps & Flow are gradually making their way as a replacement to InfoPath & SharePoint Designer. Today we have an app for almost everything which makes our life easier, the problem is when we cannot get these apps to communicate with each other. This is when an app like Flow comes into use.  
Microsoft Flow 
Microsoft Flow comes with numerous templates that can be used as it is or easily customized to suit company needs. It is super simple and easy to use, be it developers looking to reiterate complex mechanisms or end users trying to automate simple tasks, there’s something for everybody. The best part it is compatible with third-party apps. Just imagine how simple things would be if you could get someone to track emails, social media accounts, customer responses and integrate them with CRM tools. 
Microsoft PowerApps 
PowerApps allows a user to build mobile-friendly business apps. One can easily create forms, and interfaces for CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) operations without the need for a developer. Like Flow, PowerApps can be integrated with cloud services such as Dynamics CRM, Salesforce, OneDrive, SharePoint, SQL and Oracle databases and SAP. 
When used in combination, Flow and PowerApps can be used to design apps to automate processes. 
Microsoft Flow and PowerApps in comparison with SharePoint Designer Workflow 
Microsoft Flow and Power Apps work great for simple applications like payroll activities, document review, resource hiring. When we move towards complex enterprise workflows, they do have some limitations. PowerApps & Flow may not be capable of handling complex or long running processes. However, it is certain that they will be the default tools for business automation in SharePoint moving forward.  
Conclusion 
While nothing is official, yet it would be advisable to start creating your workflows with Microsoft Flow. Migration is not easy, but it is relatively easier if you start adopting changes earlier. Whatever be your tools, it is automation is the ultimate winner. For any business to be successful you need cost minimization, greater efficiency, and streamlined processes. Office 365 offers each of them at no additional cost. Capitalize on digital transformation and be future-ready.
