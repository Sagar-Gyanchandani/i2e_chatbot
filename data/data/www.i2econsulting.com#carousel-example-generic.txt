We have partnered with i2e for over two years now. One of the main reason is that i2e has a unique differentiation advantage by offering a complete application solution. For example, we were able to integrate our financial system SAP with Planisware and build all our reports using Power BI. All of this was completed within the i2e ecosystem. The efficiency gained during the development process and after implementation is priceless.

We had created a lot of complex workflows in using Nintex and in our SharePoint on-premise environment. it was not very economical. As we already had invested in Microsoft O365 and in the framework of the migration of SharePoint on-premise to SharePoint Online, we faced into important technical questions to figure out whether and how we would be able to want to know if we can migrate all these workflows into MS Flow. i2e weighed down all our options and even suggested edits to optimize our workflows. I would recommend Joel, Nilofer and Team for their in-depth knowledge and professionalism.

i2e team has been extremely cooperative and thoroughly engaged with us during the entire development lifecycle, and carrying out the project in a very professional manner. Truly impressed with the complete process followed by i2e right from inception phase by having multiple rounds of discussion to freeze and sign off on the requirements, before taking up the development work. Having periodic weekly reviews with ACGI team always helped to track the work progress and point out any deviations/risks, and mitigate the same. It’s been an absolute pleasure working with i2e.
