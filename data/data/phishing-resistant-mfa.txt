SSE & SASEOverviewPricingProductsSolutionsAnalyst reportsResourcesActivate phishing-resistant MFAThwart phishers with security keys and Zero Trust
Targeted account takeover and supply chain attacks are some of the most dangerous threat vectors
Acquire, activate, and authenticate every access request with FIDO-compliant security keys, like YubiKeys
Read the solution briefCase studyCloudflare stopped an SMS phishing attackMore than 130 companies have recently been targeted in a series of similar account takeover attacks through social engineering. Our strong authentication, as part of our larger Zero Trust strategy, caused the threat actor to fail.How we stopped it with security keysCloudflare’s security team received reports of (1) employees receiving legitimate-looking text messages pointing to what appeared to be (2) Cloudflare’s Okta login page. While the threat actor attempted to log in with compromised credentials (3-4), they could not get past the security key requirement that Cloudflare Zero Trust activated.
While security keys are not a silver bullet against all attacks, they strengthen the barrier and work in conjunction with additional Zero Trust security measures such as DNS filtering, browser isolation, cloud email security, and more.Read the case studyWith Zero TrustWithout Zero TrustSelectively enforce strong authenticationDon't just support it. Require it.
Identity providers may support strong authentication but may not allow you to truly require it
Ensure FIDO2 authentication is required, especially for apps housing sensitive data, and enforce per user, app, geography, or group
With Zero TrustWithout Zero TrustRoll out strong authentication everywhereZTNA makes it easy
Broad MFA support exists for cloud services, but this can be more difficult with legacy or non-web apps
ZTNA acts as an aggregation layer around all your SaaS, self-hosted, and non-web resources, which makes strong authentication easier to enforce across all of them
