Custom SharePoint document management system 









A comprehensive SharePoint Document Management System (DMS) customized and fine-tuned to your specific needs. 



Why go for a custom SharePoint DMS? 



 



 As a Microsoft Gold partner, i2e Consulting specializes in designing and implementing custom SharePoint Document Management Systems (DMS) to meet the unique needs of your organization. 













What our custom SharePoint DMS solution offers? 









End-to-end document management 



Embrace the SharePoint capability with customized workflows to support the complete document management lifecycle right from document creation to approval. We can customize the document management workflows as per your organization’s needs. Our team can also integrate DocuSign to streamline document signing processes, enhancing efficiency and compliance.  







 











 







Process automation 



Customized automated document approval processes such as auto archiving old document versions once the new documents are approved. Our experts can also loop in Power Automate to achieve any customized automation you need. 











Document search and retrieval 



Our custom SharePoint DMS can streamline your document search by creating custom metadata, restricting the search to chosen SharePoint sites, and creating additional filters for effective search. We can also give you advanced search capabilities including full-text search, faceted search, content indexing, and search result relevancy ranking 







 











 







Document versioning and integrity 



Through our custom DMS solution, organizations can enforce document versioning controls. By securely managing document versions and preventing unauthorized modifications, organizations can demonstrate compliance with SOX requirements for maintaining accurate and reliable financial information.

Access control and permission management 



Our custom SharePoint DMS can enforce strict access control policies. This includes implementing role-based access control (RBAC), assigning permissions at the document level, and restricting access based on user roles, departments, or project teams. This helps to uphold cybersecurity standards and comply with SOX regulations regarding data protection. 







 











 







Encryption and data protection 



Our experts can implement encryption mechanisms within the custom SharePoint DMS to safeguard data both at rest and in transit. This ensures that even if data is intercepted or compromised, it remains unintelligible to unauthorized parties. 











Audit trails and logging 



We incorporate robust auditing and logging capabilities to track user activities, document access, and changes made within the system. By maintaining comprehensive audit logs, organizations can demonstrate accountability and ensure adherence to best practices. 







 











 







Copilot chatbot 



We can build a Gen AI chatbot that provides intuitive assistance for document-related tasks. Leveraging advanced AI capabilities, it offers personalized recommendations, assists with document retrieval, and automates routine tasks, enhancing productivity and user satisfaction within the DMS environment. 











Training and ongoing support  



After implementing the custom SharePoint DMS solution, we also offer comprehensive training to ensure users understand the system’s features and workflows, maximizing adoption and productivity. Our team will also provide assistance, updates, and troubleshoot the evolving user needs and ensure the DMS continues to meet organizational requirements effectively. 







 











 







Customized UI/UX 



Looking to customize SharePoint UI/UX as per your branding guidelines, we got you covered. Our experts are well-versed in SharePoint SPFX framework and can customize the SharePoint DMS user interface by building web parts, extensions, and other components using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
