Indication and Asset Prioritization  



Strategic prioritization for   high-value opportunities. 



Accelerating success through smart prioritization  








 






 We enable BD&L teams to identify, evaluate, and prioritize the most promising indications and assets to license or acquire.   








01 



Prioritization 



Identification of high–lifecycle value candidates, analysis of clinical and commercial viability through meta-analysis, modeling, and simulation. Our approach quantifies potential value considering development costs, regulatory risks, reimbursement exposure, and competitive landscape evolution.  









02 



Positioning 



We help you develop and communicate compelling clinical differentiation and commercial analytics to maximize deal value. Our domain experts and proprietary algorithms also inform target pricing scenarios and design of value-based contracts. 









03 



Selection 



BD teams can zero in on the right indications and assets to expand pipelines and portfolios. We turn real-world evidence into actionable insights, forecasts, and risk analyses that objectively prioritize opportunities. This enhances deal sourcing and evaluation while optimizing capital allocation.
