SSE & SASEOverviewPricingProductsSolutionsAnalyst reportsResourcesSecure Third Party Access Give third party collaborators a first class experience, with fast and safe access to applicationsProviding application access to collaborators outside your organization — whether they’re contract workers, agencies, or partner organizations — can be a security risk and a logistical headache. Learn how Cloudflare Access makes connecting 3rd party users to workforce apps secure and simple.Sign UpContact SalesThe challenge of sharing identity sourcesIf your team has an application that you need to share with partners or contractors, both parties need to agree on a source of identity. Some teams opt to solve that challenge by onboarding external users to their own identity provider. When contractors join a project, the IT department receives help desk tickets to create new user accounts in the organization directory. Contractors receive instructions on how to sign-up. They spend time creating passwords and learning the new tool, and then use those credentials to login.Multi-SSO with Cloudflare AccessAccess allows you to use multiple sources of identity to grant different groups of users access to the same application. This gives you the flexibility to extend access to external users (3rd parties, contractors, vendors) without having to onboard them onto your centralized Identity Provider.Manage third party access confidently with Zero Trust accessCloudflare Access delivers Zero Trust access for third party collaborators, helping you enforce least privilege across all applications without additional overhead.3rd party access use casesIntegrate multiple identity providers Your contractors can bring their own existing identities from LinkedIn, GitHub, Google or other providers for seamless login. IT teams save time and resources by keeping contractors out of the corporate identity tenant. Security gains peace of mind knowing third-party users have narrowly scoped permissions.Time-based OTPs for authenticationGuest users can authenticate with time-based one-time passwords based on user email addresses.Granular access policiesAdopt Zero Trust best practices by applying least privilege: Only provide your partners access to the apps they need to be successful and eliminate the unnecessary risks of granting permissions for apps they won’t even use.Monitor user access and change logsView and search real-time access logs in the dashboard or send to a third party SIEM for analysis.
