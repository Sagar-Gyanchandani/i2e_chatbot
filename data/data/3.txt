Customer story: Rolls Royce                

A single disruption to a plane and its inevitable effect to an entire airline can cost up to one million dollars a day. That’s why at Rolls Royce, they use IoT tech from Azure to help identify problems before they’re issues. With early notice, airlines can reduce inventory costs and maximize availability of parts. Saving airlines millions. While the savings are great, it’s not always easy to adopt a new IoT system.

Customer Story: Fresno Unified School District                

Fifth-grader Ryan Fernandez’s engagement in the classroom changed when his teacher brought #Office365 and Microsoft Teams into his classroom. These tools enabled Ryan to leverage and focus his energy, spend more time helping other students, and actively direct his own learning.
Ryan is a shining example of the ways in which technology can reach every student and be customized to meet their individual needs. Here at i2e Consulting, we are interested in using technology to give educators the resources to help each and every student succeed.
