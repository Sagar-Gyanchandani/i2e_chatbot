i2e Consulting goes virtual first. - i2e Consulting                                

February 5, 2021                                

Remote work will be the primary experience for all employees at i2e consulting globally. The company has decided against adopting a hybrid model to keep things fair with respect to performance or career trajectory. 
“Work wherever it makes sense to you. Two of our team members have followed their passion for organic farming, and one has mastered baking, then there are others, who rekindled with their hobbies in forced lockdown. At i2e, employee well-being is a priority and periodic surveys suggested an increased in wellness. Flexibility, lack of work commute in addition to quality family time made remote work alluring. So, we think this is the best thing going forward.”, says Vishal Rane, COO i2e Consulting 
“However, we do understand that some homes are especially not conducive for office work, we are working on what works best for them. We will invest in collaborative spaces to conduct meetings, gatherings, and community events so the team does not miss the human connection. These will be more like studio spaces and not your regular office. There has been little to no glitch in conducting business these past few months, the team has shown tremendous character, this makes us hopeful that this will works.”, he further added.
