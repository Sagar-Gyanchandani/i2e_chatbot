SSE & SASEOverviewPricingProductsSolutionsAnalyst reportsResourcesCloudflare DLPProtecting your organization’s most sensitive dataWith the shift to hybrid work, it is harder than ever to maintain visibility and security controls over how users move and store data across cloud environments. At the same time, the financial and reputational risks to losing sensitive data are higher than ever – with IBM’s latest research estimating the average cost of a data breach at $4.35M.
