 At-cost pricing for registration and renewal
Domain name registration is dominated by companies offering large discounts on the initial domain name purchase and then later surprising customers with incremental add-on fees and inflated renewal costs.
Cloudflare Registrar will only ever charge you what we pay to the registry for your domain. No markup and no surprise fees. Security features like two-factor authentication, multi-user support, and a security-focused customer support team gives you peace of mind that your domain is safe.
