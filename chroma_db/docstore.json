Whether choosing the best asset development plan, mapping market entry strategies, navigating access and reimbursement landscapes, or optimizing supply chain operations, Clairvoyance equips you with foresight to drive commercial success.\n\nAbout Clairvoyance\n\nClairvoyance offers a consolidated view of the project portfolio, providing senior executives with a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making. Efficiently managed project data can provide crucial financial and operational metrics such as project delivery milestone dates, development cost forecast, and revenue forecasts, with appropriate risk adjustments based on Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success (PTRS) and potential market events. Clairvoyance automates project data integration, data aggregation and summarizes crucial portfolio metrics and portfolio insights, all in one consolidated dashboard.\n\nWhy Clairvoyance?\n\nThe biopharmaceutical R&D industry presents a high-risk, high-value business model which depends on solid strategic portfolio management capabilities to fully exploit the near-term potential of inline brands while optimizing future pipeline growth through disciplined R&D investment and targeted business development. Biopharma pipeline development lifecycles have traditionally been long and as a consequence,  fast and integrated decision tools were not a priority for this sector.  With recent breakthrough in scientific discovery and the emergence of more personalized disease therapy modalities affecting the shape, speed, cost and competition in clinical development, there is an emerging urgency to develop robust pipeline analytics to better understand and manage risk, secure value and sustain corporate growth.\n\nThe biopharma industry is data rich but their traditionally siloed scientific, development and commercial functions have made it difficult to assemble the pipeline knowledge required to prepare real-time portfolio insight, analysis and investment options. Traditional approaches of deploying fragmented point solutions or custom one-off projects simply cannot scale to meet the evolving needs of your organization. Point solutions provide temporary fixes but lack the adaptability for long-term robustness. While custom builds allow for tailored solutions, their static nature cannot persist or flex with your changing priorities and market dynamics. You're forced to compromise - sacrificing control for rapid customizability or vice versa. Biopharma organizations have now realised the importance of investing in enterprise data architectures and technologies to align essential but disparate data from across the organization to enable data driven decisions to the top of the value stream.  This is a huge step forward for the industry and precisely where Clairvoyance fills the need.  Good decision making is as much an art as it is a science.  The fit-for-purpose decision analytics platform was designed by industry leading practitioners who are battle-hardened in strategic portfolio management.  They have architected and developed a portfolio decision platform,  configurable to interface with standard enterprise data systems and custom fit to adapt to \n\nClairvoyance presents a better path forward that doesn't require trading off governance for agility. This enables you to establish a future-proof architecture for comprehensive data integration, advanced analytics, and democratized insights tailored to your unique business processes.\n\nWith a unified data and analytics platform purposely built for life sciences, you can maintain full control while empowering ongoing customization aligned to your strategic roadmap. This powerful pairing of enterprise governance and autonomous configuration finally breaks the constraints of past approaches. As a leader driving transformation, you now have a way to truly future-proof your data and analytics investments without compromise.\n\nCentralized and customizable: Clairvoyance has centralized data aggregation from across your project portfolio, removing the challenges of data living in silos. Its comprehensive dashboard view, KPI reporting and interactive controls, customizable alerts and notifications enable you to access on-demand reports and insights. \n\nAutomated real time data synchronization: Real-time data ensures your forecasts are based on the latest information, reducing the risk of basing decisions on outdated or inaccurate data. This can lead to more precise forecasts and a better understanding of trends, enabling you to identify potential issues or opportunities as they arise.

We help therapy area leaders avoid pitfalls such as focus on short term trade-offs that derail long-term organizational growth, concessions arising due to lack of data visibility into the asset pipeline, answering what-if scenarios confidently.\n\n\n\n\nClairvoyance for Big Pharma\n\n\n\nThe traditionally siloed scientific, development and commercial functions in biopharma companies have made it difficult to assemble the pipeline knowledge required to prepare real-time portfolio insight, analysis, and investment options. To enable visibility and transparency, portfolio leaders have looked to either point solutions or custom development.\n\n\n\nTraditional approaches of deploying fragmented point solutions or custom one-off projects simply cannot scale to meet the evolving needs of your organization. Point solutions provide temporary fixes but lack the adaptability for long-term robustness. While custom builds allow for tailored solutions, their static nature cannot persist or flex with your changing priorities and market dynamics. You're forced to compromise - sacrificing control for rapid customizability or vice versa.\n\n\n\nOur fit-for-purpose decision analytics platform has been designed by industry leading practitioners who are highly sought after advisors in strategic portfolio management.\u00a0 They have architected and developed a portfolio decision platform,\u00a0configurable to interface with standard enterprise data systems and custom fit to adapt to existing systems.\n\n\n\nAs an enterprise-scale R&D dashboard platform, Clairvoyance provides an unparalleled level of visibility into your entire R&D pipeline, enabling you to track and monitor projects across multiple therapeutic areas, phases, and geographies.

However, fragmented data in disconnected tools and systems obscures this view, leading to inaccurate forecasting and suboptimal resource utilization.\n\nOur integrated reporting bundle solves this by consolidating and harmonizing resource data from your PPM solution and enterprise timesheets into a centralized reporting fabric. This provides a \"single source of truth\" for complete resource insights spanning forecasted, scheduled, and actual work.\n\nAt the core is a robust data integration layer connecting your project management tools like Planisware to timesheet platforms using APIs and web services. Automated ETL pipelines flow resource assignment data, task estimates, and schedule plans from the PPM system.\n\nThis information is intelligently mapped to timesheet entries capturing actuals like hours logged per task, earned value metrics, downtime and more. Customizable roll-up structures and data models align with your specific operational hierarchies.\n\nThe integrated data repository feeds a portfolio of pre-built reports, dashboards, and analytics tailored for different resource management personas - from workforce managers to financial controllers and executive leadership.\n\nInteractive visualizations provide unified visibility into resource demand vs supply, forecasted vs actual expenditure, project burdens, profitability metrics and more. Drill into root-cause analysis of deviations between planned effort and actuals.\n\nHow can you leverage i2e\u2019s reporting bundle?\n\nCustomizations: This is a tool agnostic offering, whether you use Planisware or any other PPM tool, we can create a customized dashboard on Spotfire, Tableau or Power BI, helping you drive resource accountability. AI-assisted variance decomposition and anomaly detection rapidly surfaces underutilized resources, skills shortages, projects at risk and other areas requiring attention. Automated alerts and notifications drive timely intervention.\n\nTransparency: Our flexible self-service reporting solution and data blending empower advanced ad-hoc analysis without ongoing IT/BI team dependency.\n\nBetter decision making: With a seamless integration of PPM and timesheet data, resource managers finally gain multidimensional insights to optimize resource usage, control costs, enhance productivity and ensure strategic execution across portfolios.\n\nRead more about our implementation of customized reporting bundles in Big Pharma here. <insert link>", "start_char_idx": 5153, "end_char_idx": 9138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "463e92e0-9abb-4096-bb20-1509e0813342": {"__data__": {"id_": "463e92e0-9abb-4096-bb20-1509e0813342", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\sagar.gyanchandani\\Desktop\\hackathon\\data\\data\\Where are you in your Planisware journey.txt", "file_name": "Where are you in your Planisware journey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4668, "creation_date": "2024-05-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-10"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fac3a868-a992-4ad1-a20f-e44326cfa181", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\sagar.gyanchandani\\Desktop\\hackathon\\data\\data\\Where are you in your Planisware journey.txt", "file_name": "Where are you in your Planisware journey.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4668, "creation_date": "2024-05-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-10"}, "hash": "1bb988af2c1d5db20b5879bf3407053ee98a6bb5c8f7505f3c2be03d3c54dfc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Planisware Partnership Services\n\nWhere are you in your Planisware journey?\n\n<Explore our services>\n\n\n\n         Whether you're just beginning to explore Planisware or seeking to maximize its benefits\n\n                                  i2e Consulting \u2013 a trusted Planisware partner \u2013 is here for you\n\n\n\nOur Services\n\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nOur consultants will work closely with key stakeholders to conduct a thorough audit of your existing processes to determine which tool aligns best with your business goals.
